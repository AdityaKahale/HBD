                <h1>Happy Birthday Tanvi! ðŸŽ‰</h1>
                <p>
                    Weâ€™ve known each other for yearsâ€”same school, same tuitionâ€”yet never spoke a word.  
                    Then COVID-19 happened, and our friendship started through texts.  
                    No calls, no meetings, just endless messages, and somehow, that was enough to build something truly special.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I wasnâ€™t the nicest at firstâ€”rude, sarcastic, always teasing you for being short ðŸ˜†.  
                    But despite all that, you stuck around. From random jokes to deep conversations,  
                    from roasting each other to actually having each otherâ€™s backs, this friendship has been amazing.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, on your special day, stay as you are, keep smiling, and be ready for more teasing  
                    because some things never change! ðŸ˜œ  
                </p>
                <h2>Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‚âœ¨</h2>
